# update_spices.sh
Script to Update Cinnamon's Spices

Linux Mint update app takes care of both System and Cinnamon's Spice (applets, desklets, themes and extensions) Updates. If using other OS, you depend on using the command line or installing an applet called Spices Update https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/applets/view/309 . update_spices.sh is an unobstrusive alternative. Just place it on you local bin directory and configure it to run at startup. It will download all Spices' updates and restart cinnamon.
